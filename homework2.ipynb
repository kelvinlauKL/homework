      "\n",
      "1. **Mutability**: Lists in Python are mutable by default. `data.copy()` explicitly creates a copy, similar to dealing with value types in Swift.  Alternatively, a full slice `data[:]` would also produce a copy.  If in-place sorting is the desired outcome, the function can be adapted to directly modify the input `data` and not return a value.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Looping**: Python uses `for...in range()` rather than the C-style `for` loop familiar to Swift developers. The `while` loop is fairly similar.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Array Access**: Python uses brackets (`[]`) for list indexing, just like Swift.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **String Interpolation**: Python's f-strings provide similar functionality to Swift's string interpolation.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **No Explicit Types**: Python is dynamically typed. You don't need to specify the type of the list elements. The code will work correctly as long as the elements are comparable.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "This implementation closely mirrors the logic of insertion sort as you would write it in Swift, while incorporating Pythonic idioms.\n",
      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "User: What is the time complexity?\n",
      "Model: The time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) in the worst-case and average-case scenarios.  This occurs when the input list is sorted in reverse order, requiring the maximum number of comparisons and shifts for each element.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the best-case scenario, where the input list is already sorted, the time complexity is O(n). This is because the inner `while` loop never executes, and the algorithm simply iterates through the list once.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a breakdown:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Worst-case (Reverse-sorted):**  Each element needs to be compared with all the preceding elements, resulting in approximately n*(n-1)/2 comparisons and shifts, which simplifies to O(n^2).\n",
      "* **Average-case (Randomly ordered):** On average, each element needs to be compared with about half of the preceding elements, still leading to O(n^2) complexity.\n",
      "* **Best-case (Already sorted):** The inner loop's condition is never met, so only the outer loop runs n times, resulting in O(n) complexity.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "While insertion sort isn't the most efficient sorting algorithm for large datasets, it has certain advantages that can make it preferable in specific situations:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Simple implementation**: The code is straightforward and easy to understand.\n",
      "* **In-place sorting**: With a minor adjustment, it can operate directly on the input list without needing extra memory.\n",
      "* **Efficient for small lists or nearly sorted lists**:  Its performance degrades significantly as input size grows, but for small lists or those that are already almost sorted, it can be quite fast.  In fact, it's often faster than more complex algorithms like quicksort or mergesort for very small lists due to lower overhead.\n",
      "* **Stable sorting**: It preserves the relative order of equal elements, a property that can be important in some applications.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "User: What is the space complexity?\n",
      "Model: The space complexity of the provided `insertion_sort` implementation is O(n) because it creates a copy of the input list.  This copy, `sorted_data`, takes up space proportional to the number of elements in the original list.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it's important to distinguish between this implementation and the general concept of insertion sort.  Insertion sort can be implemented *in-place*, meaning it can operate directly on the input list without needing a separate copy. An in-place implementation would have a space complexity of O(1), meaning it uses constant extra space regardless of the input size.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's how you could modify the code to be in-place (O(1) space complexity):\n",
